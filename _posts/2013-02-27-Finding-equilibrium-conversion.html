<p>
A common problem to solve in reaction engineering is finding the equilibrium conversion.<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> A typical problem to solve is the following nonlinear equation:
</p>

<p>
\(1.44 = \frac{X_e^2}{(1-X_e)^2}\)
</p>

<p>
To solve this we create a function:
</p>

<p>
\(f(X_e)=0=1.44 - \frac{X_e^2}{(1-X_e)^2}\)
</p>

<p>
and use a nonlinear solver to find the value of \(X_e\) that makes this function equal to zero. We have to provide an initial guess. Chemical intuition suggests that the solution must be between 0 and 1, and mathematical intuition suggests the solution might be near 0.5 (which would give a ratio near 1).
</p>

<p>
Here is our solution.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">from</span> scipy.optimize <span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> fsolve

<span style="color: #8b0000;">def</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">func</span>(Xe):
    z = 1.44 - (Xe**2)/(1-Xe)**2
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">return</span> z

X0 = 0.5
Xe, = fsolve(func, X0)
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">'The equilibrium conversion is X = {0:1.2f}'</span>.format(Xe))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
The equilibrium conversion is X = 0.55
