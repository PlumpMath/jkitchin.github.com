<p>
I have been using auto-capitalize.el for a short time to automatically capitalize the beginning of sentences. I mostly like what it does, but in org-mode I tend to write short code blocks while still in org-mode, and it is pretty irritating for auto-capitalize to "fix" the capitalization of your code. Of course, I can type C-c ' to edit the block in its native mode, but I do not always want to do that.
</p>

<p>
Below, I illustrate an approach to turn off auto-capitalize-mode when the cursor is inside a code-block. Basically, we write a function that checks if you are in a src-block, and if auto-capitalize is on, turn it off. If you are not in the code-block, we turn auto-capitalize on if it is not on. Then we hook the function into post-command-hook, which will run it after every emacs command, including cursor movements.
</p>

<p>
Here is that code:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #8b0000;">defun</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">dwiw-auto-capitalize</span> ()
  (<span style="color: #8b0000;">if</span> (org-in-block-p '(<span style="color: #228b22;">"src"</span>))
      (<span style="color: #8b0000;">when</span> auto-capitalize
        (auto-capitalize-mode -1))
    (<span style="color: #8b0000;">unless</span> auto-capitalize
      (auto-capitalize-mode 1))))

(add-hook 'post-command-hook 'dwiw-auto-capitalize)
</pre>
</div>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">dwiw-auto-capitalize</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
It works! Now the minor mode turns on and off depending on where the cursor is in my org document.
