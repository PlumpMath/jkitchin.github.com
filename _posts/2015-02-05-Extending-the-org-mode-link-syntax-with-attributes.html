<p>
I make super heavy use of links in org-mode. I use them extensively in org-ref to create functional citations. One detail that has never been very satisfactory is the need for pre/post text in citations. I don't need that capability often, but it seems important to some. I have implemented a kind of clunky solution where I use the description part of a link with the pre/post text separated by a ::. Although that works, I dislike the way it looks, the need to parse it, and that the description covers the link.
</p>

<pre class="example">
[[cite:key][pre text::post text]]
</pre>

<p>
Some <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2010-08/msg00404.html">time ago</a> there was a suggestion of how to extend the link syntax, which was to my knowledge never implemented. Here is the proposed syntax:
</p>
<pre class="example">
$[link http://google.com
         :last-followed [2009-02-25 Wed 02:00]
         :label "click here for evil search engine"
         :export-label "click here for nice search engine"]
</pre>

<p>
This is interesting because this syntax suggests the link has attributes which can be updated.
</p>

<p>
We will show here how to implement part of this idea with the existing link syntax. We will make a link that has attributes like that. The basic idea is to simply incorporate the attributes into the path, and use lisp to read them. We will wrap the link path in parentheses and read that as a lisp data structure. So, a link like <i>link:key :pre "some pre text" :post "some post text"</i> will be parsed as:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(read <span style="color: #008000;">"(key :pre \"some pre text\" :post \"some post text\")"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">key</td>
<td class="left">:pre</td>
<td class="left">some pre text</td>
<td class="left">:post</td>
<td class="left">some post text</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
The car of that list is the key, and the cdr contains the attributes. The quotes are necessary here to make sure all the text is correctly parsed as a single element for each attribute. So, here is an example link
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(org-add-link-type
 <span style="color: #008000;">"slink"</span>
 <span style="color: #8D8D84;">;;  </span><span style="color: #8D8D84; font-style: italic;">follow function</span>
 (<span style="color: #0000FF;">lambda</span> (path)
   (<span style="color: #0000FF;">let*</span> ((data (read (format <span style="color: #008000;">"(%s)"</span> path)))
          (head (car data))
          (plist (cdr data))
          (link (org-element-context))
          (begin (org-element-property <span style="color: #006FE0;">:begin</span> link))
          (end (org-element-property <span style="color: #006FE0;">:end</span> link)))
     (setq plist (plist-put plist <span style="color: #006FE0;">:last-clicked</span> (current-time-string)))
     (<span style="color: #0000FF;">save-excursion</span>
     (setf (buffer-substring begin end) <span style="color: #008000;">""</span>)
     (goto-char begin)
     (insert (format <span style="color: #008000;">"[[slink:%s %s]]"</span> head
         (substring (format <span style="color: #008000;">"%S"</span> plist) 1 -1))))))
 <span style="color: #8D8D84;">;; </span><span style="color: #8D8D84; font-style: italic;">format function</span>
 (<span style="color: #0000FF;">lambda</span> (path description backend)
   (<span style="color: #0000FF;">let*</span> ((data (read (concat <span style="color: #008000;">"("</span> path <span style="color: #008000;">")"</span>)))
          (head (car data))
          (plist (cadr data)))
     (format <span style="color: #008000;">"\\%s[%s][%s]{%s}"</span>
             (plist-get plist <span style="color: #006FE0;">:type</span>)
             (plist-get plist <span style="color: #006FE0;">:pre</span>)
             (plist-get plist <span style="color: #006FE0;">:post</span>)
             head))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, each time I click on this link, the time stamp gets updated.
</p>

<p>
\nil[nil][nil]{kitchin-2010}
</p>

<pre class="example">
[[slink:kitchin-2010 :pre "See for example" :post "page 47" :type "cite" :last-clicked "Thu Feb  5 09:31:15 2015"]]
</pre>


<p>
And, the generic export of this link is:
</p>

<pre class="example">
\cite[See for example][page 47]{kitchin-2010}
</pre>

<p>
Is this a good idea? I am not using this for anything right now. Sometimes my version of org-mode has trouble recognizing that is a link. It is strange, as I am typing, sometimes it flashes in and out of being recognized as a link. Anyway, it is an interesting idea!</p>
