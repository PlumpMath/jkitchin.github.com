<p>
Four new MS students are joining the group!
</p>

<p>
Zhaofeng Chen will use density functional theory to model segregation in noble metal alloys.
</p>

<p>
Venkatesh Naik will investigate the apeciation of carbon dioxide in alkaline and amine‚Äêcontaining solutions using Raman spectroscopy.
</p>

<p>
Hari Thirumalai will examine the effects of dispersion on scaling relations of atomic adsorbates using density functional theory.
</p>

<p>
Siddharth Deshpande will be co-advised by <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/me/people/venkat-viswanathan.html">Prof. Viswanathan</a> in Mechanical Engineering to use density functional theory to investigate non-precious metal sulfides for the oxygen reduction reaction.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to the group!
