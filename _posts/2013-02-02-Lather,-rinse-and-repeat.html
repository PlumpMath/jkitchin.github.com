<p>
Recursive functions are functions that call themselves repeatedly until some exit condition is met. Today we look at a classic example of recursive function for computing a factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted n!, and is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
</p>

<p>
The key ideas in defining a recursive function is that there needs to be some logic to identify when to terminate the function. Then, you need logic that calls the function again, but with a smaller part of the problem. Here we recursively call the function with n-1 until it gets called with n=0. 0! is defined to be 1.

    <span style="color: #228b22;">'''compute the factorial recursively. Note if you put a negative</span>
<span style="color: #228b22;">    number in, this function will never end. We also do not check if</span>
<span style="color: #228b22;">    n is an integer.'''</span>
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">if</span> n == 0:
        <span style="color: #8b0000;">return</span> 1
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">else:</span>
        <span style="color: #8b0000;">return</span> n * recursive_factorial(n - 1)

<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> recursive_factorial(5)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
120
</pre>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">from</span> scipy.misc <span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> factorial
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> factorial(5)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
120.0
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-0-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-1"><span class="section-number-3">0.1</span> Compare to a loop solution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-1">
<p>
This example can also be solved by a loop. This loop is easier to read and understand than the recursive function. Note the recursive nature of defining the variable as itself times a number.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">n = 5
factorial_loop = 1
<span style="color: #8b0000;">for</span> i <span style="color: #8b0000;">in</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">range</span>(1, n + 1):
    factorial_loop *= i

<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> factorial_loop
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
120
</pre>

<p>
There are some significant differences in this example than in Matlab. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>the syntax of the for loop is quite different with the use of the <code>in</code> operator.
</li>
<li>python has the nice *= operator to replace a = a * i
</li>
<li>We have to loop from 1 to n+1 because the last number in the range is not returned.
</li>
</ol>

Recursive functions have a special niche in mathematical programming. There is often another way to accomplish the same goal. That is not always true though, and in a future post we will examine cases where recursion is the only way to solve a problem.
