<p>
Here we look at a way to get tool tips on text in Emacs. This would be helpful for giving hints, or definitions, or reminders about something. Tool tips are created by setting the help-echo text property for the string of interest. We will write a function that adds the tool tip to every instance of a string in the current buffer. We will also change the color of the string slightly to give the reader a hint there might be something there.
</p>

<p>
Here is the code. We use save-excursion so that the cursor stays where it starts. Then we search for the string we want a tool tip on, and set the appropriate properties.

<p>
What is a foobar?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">; </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">add a tooltip to every instance of foobar</span>
(<span style="color: #8b0000;">save-excursion</span>  <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">;</span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">return cursor to current-point</span>
  (goto-char 1)
    (<span style="color: #8b0000;">while</span> (search-forward <span style="color: #228b22;">"foobar"</span> (point-max) t)
      (set-text-properties  (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)
                            `(help-echo <span style="color: #228b22;">"You know... a bar for foos!"</span>
                             font-lock-face (<span style="color: #cd0000;">:foreground</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">"dark slate gray"</span>))
)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
After you run the function above, the next sentence should have a grayed word in it, and when you hold your mouse over the grayed word a tool tip should appear.
</p>

<p>
There is a foobar in the woods.

<p>
You can see the effect here:

<p>
This could be an interesting way to increase the depth and richness of text. To use it you would have to define a function that runs when a file is opened, or call the function after opening a file.
