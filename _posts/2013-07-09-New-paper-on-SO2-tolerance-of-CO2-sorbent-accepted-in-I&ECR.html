Our paper "Effects of O2 and SO2 on the capture capacity of a primary-amine based polymeric CO2 sorbent" by Alexander Hallenbeck and John R. Kitchin was accepted today in Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research. In this paper we showed that the ion exchange resin OC1065 is  susceptible to poisoning by SO2, but that it can be partially chemically regenerated. It can also be damaged by long term exposure to air at elevated temperatures.
