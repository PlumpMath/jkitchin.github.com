(In case that isn't clear, it is a Python with a Lisp, and somewhat how I feel trying to see what this is all about ;)
</p>

<p>
I have been chipping away at HyDE, the Hy Development Environment. So far I have reasonable support for eldoc in hy code, and some integration into lispy.
</p>

<p>
The executive summary here is:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We have a first approach at getting eldoc to work.
</li>
<li>We have better integration with lispy, including the inline describe and arg functionality, and jump to symbol.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
You may want to just watch the video to see what it is about: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m62oiB6Feeo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m62oiB6Feeo</a> 
</p>

<p>
The full details of these implementations are described at the end of this post. For now, we just load the functionality here:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #0000FF;">require</span> '<span style="color: #D0372D;">mile-hy</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
mile-hy
</pre>

<p>
Some examples of usage:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-hy">(list (<span style="color: #006FE0;">butlast</span> [12 34 56]))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
[12L, 34L]
</pre>




<p>
For details of the implementations see the following discussion.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/jmax/blob/master/mile-hy.el">https://github.com/jkitchin/jmax/blob/master/mile-hy.el</a> includes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Setting up hy-mode with a repl (partly from lispy)
</li>
<li>an eldoc function
</li>
<li>some hooks for hy-mode to setup some functionality.
</li>
<li>A hy src block expansion template for org-mode
</li>
<li>the contents of what I previously called ob-hy.el
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These things don't work without the code at <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/hy/blob/hydoc/hy/core/hylp.hy">https://github.com/jkitchin/hy/blob/hydoc/hy/core/hylp.hy</a> which provides some hy functions to get eldoc strings, and file locations. These are still work in progress, but functional at this point.
</p>

<p>
I also adapted some parts of lispy to support hy better in my fork:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/lispy/blob/hydoc/le-hy.el">https://github.com/jkitchin/lispy/blob/hydoc/le-hy.el</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/lispy/blob/hydoc/lispy-inline.el">https://github.com/jkitchin/lispy/blob/hydoc/lispy-inline.el</a> 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are not fully ready to be integrated to lispy yet, as the functionality here depends on the hy code (in hylp.hy) that isn't part of hy yet. I hacked lispy anyway to see how easy it would be to extend it for hy. So far, it looks promising.
</p>

<p>
All of these put together lead to:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/jmax/blob/master/mile-hy.el#L20">eldoc support in hy</a> code
</li>
<li>lispy support for <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/lispy/blob/hydoc/lispy-inline.el#L247">C-1 descriptions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/lispy/blob/hydoc/lispy-inline.el#L147">C-2 args</a> inline.
</li>
<li>lispy support for <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/lispy/blob/hydoc/le-hy.el#L121">M-. to jump</a> to symbol definitions (although it is a tad hacky and uses <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/hy/blob/hydoc/hy/core/hylp.hy#L342">hy to generate an org-link</a> to open the code files at the line of the definition ;).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is far from fully functional and there are some issues to resolve. The code will also probably change as I resolve some of those issues, but it works well enough to put some ideas out there. Feedback is welcome!
</p>

<p>
The eldoc functions work pretty well for the hy stuff. They don't work too well on the python side. The function at <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/hy/blob/hydoc/hy/core/hylp.hy#L120">https://github.com/jkitchin/hy/blob/hydoc/hy/core/hylp.hy#L120</a> is where some improvement is needed. Right now it really only catches a few types of symbols.
</p>

<p>
For learning hylang a documentation sprint would be great.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Add examples to the functions.
</li>
<li>Add documentation to the compiler @build definitions. Find a way to make this discoverable the way they are for functions and macros.
</li>
<li>Figure out how to get Python help in. It might be confusing because the syntax and examples will be different.
</li>
</ol>
