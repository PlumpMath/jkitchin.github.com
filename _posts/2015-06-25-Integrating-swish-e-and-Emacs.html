<p>
<a href="http://swish-e.org">swish-e</a> is a software package that indexes files on your computer, and then allows you to search the index. Spotlight on my Mac is not working too well (sometimes not at all), and I want some more flexibility so today we try getting swish-e up and running and integrated with Emacs. I don't know that swish-e is the best tool for this available, but it has been on my radar a <i>long</i> time (probably since 2003 from this <a href="http://joshr.com/src/docs/HowToIndexAnything.pdf">article</a> ), and it was easy to setup and use.
</p>

<p>
I use homebrew, so installation was this simple:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">brew install swish-e
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To test things out, I will only index org-files. I have these all over the place, and they are not all in my org-mode agenda. So, finding them quickly would be awesome.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-text"># Example configuration file

# Tell Swish-e what to directories to index
IndexDir /Users/jkitchin/Dropbox
IndexDir "/Users/jkitchin/Box Sync"
IndexDir /Users/jkitchin/blogofile-jkitchin.github.com

# where to save the index
IndexFile /Users/jkitchin/.swish-e/index.swish-e

# What to index
IndexOnly .org

# Tell Swish-e that .txt files are to use the text parser.
IndexContents TXT* .org

# Otherwise, use the HTML parser
DefaultContents HTML*

# Ask libxml2 to report any parsing errors and warnings or
# any UTF-8 to 8859-1 conversion errors
ParserWarnLevel 9
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, we create our index.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">swish-e -c ~/.swish-e/swish.conf
</pre>
</div>

Now an example search. I have been looking into the Energy frontier research centers, and I want to find my notes on it. Here is a little query. I use a special output format to keep things simple for the parsing later, just the rank and path, separated by a tab.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">swish-e -f ~/.swish-e/index.swish-e -x <span style="color: #008000;">'%r\t%p\n'</span> -w efrc
</pre>
</div>
<pre class="example">

# Number of hits: 2
# Search time: 0.000 seconds
# Run time: 0.008 seconds
1000	/Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/org-mode/journal.org
471	/Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/org-mode/proposals.org
.
</pre>

<p>
Now, for the integration with Emacs. We just get that output in a string, split it, and get the parts we want.  I think I will use helm to provide a selection buffer to these results. We need a list of cons cells (string . candidate). Then we write an interactive helm function. We provide two sources. One for the initial query, and another to start a new search, in case you don't find what you want.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #0000FF;">defun</span> <span style="color: #006699;">helm-swish-e-candidates</span> (query)

  (<span style="color: #0000FF;">let*</span> ((result (shell-command-to-string
                  (format <span style="color: #008000;">"swish-e -f ~/.swish-e/index.swish-e -x \"%%r\t%%p\n\" -w %s"</span>
                          (shell-quote-argument query))))
         (lines (s-split <span style="color: #008000;">"\n"</span> result t))
         (candidates '()))
    (<span style="color: #0000FF;">loop</span> for line in lines
          unless (<span style="color: #0000FF;">or</span>  (s-starts-with? <span style="color: #008000;">"#"</span> line)
                      (s-starts-with? <span style="color: #008000;">"."</span> line))
          collect (cons line (cdr (s-split <span style="color: #008000;">"\t"</span> line))))))

  (helm <span style="color: #006FE0;">:sources</span> `(((name . ,(format <span style="color: #008000;">"swish-e: %s"</span> query))
                    (candidates . ,(helm-swish-e-candidates query))
                    (action . ((<span style="color: #008000;">"open"</span> . (<span style="color: #0000FF;">lambda</span> (f)
                                           (find-file (car f)))))))
                   ((name . <span style="color: #008000;">"New search"</span>)
                    (dummy)
                    (action . ((<span style="color: #008000;">"search"</span> . (<span style="color: #0000FF;">lambda</span> (f)
                                             (helm-swish-e helm-pattern)))))))))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
helm-swish-e
</pre>

<p>
Now I can run M-x helm-swish-e and enter "efrc AND computing infrastructure" to find org files containing those words, then press enter to find the file. Nice and easy. I have not tested the query syntax very fully, but so far it is working fine!
