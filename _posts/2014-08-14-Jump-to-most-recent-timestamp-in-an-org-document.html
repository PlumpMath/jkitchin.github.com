<p>
Timestamps serve many purposes in an org document: deadlines, scheduled time, record of time, etc&#x2026; Depending on the document, you may have organized a set of tasks logically, but you are completing them in some other order. Here, we examine how to jump to the most recent timestamp. 
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of an inactive (will not cause an agenda entry) timestamp <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2014-08-07 Thu]</span></span> and an active timestamp <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2014-08-13 Wed&gt;</span></span>. You can also have times in the timestamps, e.g. <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2014-08-14 Thu 13:00&gt;</span></span> or <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2014-08-14 Thu 14:00&gt;</span></span>. There may be a timestamp that is in the future <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2014-08-15 Fri]</span></span>.
</p>

<p>
We may have some headlines with a due date.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Headline with duedate</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Analyzing the timestamps in this file</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
We can get a sorted list of the time-stamps like this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(sort (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'timestamp
	(lambda (timestamp)
	  (org-element-property :raw-value timestamp))) 'org-time&gt;)
</pre>
</div>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left"><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2014-08-15 Fri]</span></span></td>
<td class="left"><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2014-08-14 Thu 14:00&gt;</span></span></td>
<td class="left"><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2014-08-14 Thu 13:00&gt;</span></span></td>
<td class="left"><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2014-08-13 Wed&gt;</span></span></td>
<td class="left"><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2014-08-07 Thu]</span></span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Interestingly, the deadline timestamp does not appear in this list! I am not sure why it doesn't show up.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, having those time stamps in this buffer will complicate further analysis, because org-mode will parse them too. What we need to do next is figure out a way to sort with the positions, so we can jump to it.
</p>

<p>
Side bar: How to sort a cons list based on the first element of each cons cell? Here are two examples.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(cl-sort '((3 . "a") (2 . "b") (1 . "c")) '&gt; :key 'car)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
((3 . a) (2 . b) (1 . c))
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(sort '((3 . "a") (2 . "b") (1 . "c"))
      (lambda (a b)
	(&gt; (car a) (car b))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
((3 . a) (2 . b) (1 . c))
</p>


<p>
So, we just build up a sorted cons-list of timestamps and their beginning characters, then pop the top entry off and jump to it. Here is the code. Running this jumps directly to the most recent (which could be in the future) timestamp.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(let ((timestamps (cl-sort
		   (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'timestamp
		     (lambda (timestamp)
		       `(,(org-element-property :raw-value timestamp) . ,(org-element-property :begin timestamp))))
		   'org-time&gt; :key 'car)))
  (goto-char
   (cdr
    (pop timestamps))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There are some limitations here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Only free timestamps are shown, timestamps associated with deadlines and scheduling do not appear to be considered here. You would need to map over the headlines and check for deadlines to get these I think.
</li>
<li>The code block above finds the timestamp with the highest time value, which may be in the future. It is an interesting exercise to think about how to find the most recent timestamp that is not in the future.
</li>
</ol>
