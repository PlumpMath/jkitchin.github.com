<p>
I wrote some emacs-lisp code in org-mode, and load them with org-babel-load-file. I thought it would be nice if there was load path for org-files, similar to the one for lisp files. Here I document what it might look like.
</p>

<p>
We need a load path to search for the org-file.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq org-load-path '("~/Dropbox/kitchingroup/jmax/"))
</pre>
</div>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">~/Dropbox/kitchingroup/jmax/</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Next, we need the function to do the loading. We need to find the org-file, and then load it.
</p>



<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun org-require (orgfile)
  "orgfile is a symbol to be loaded"
  (let ((org-file (concat (symbol-name orgfile) ".org"))
	(path))

  ;; find the org-file
  (catch 'result
    (loop for dir in org-load-path do
	  (when (file-exists-p
		 (setq path
		       (concat
			(directory-file-name dir)
			"/"
			org-file)))
	    (throw 'result path))))
  (org-babel-load-file path)))


(org-require 'org-ref)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Loaded ~/Dropbox/kitchingroup/jmax/org-ref.el
</pre>

<p>
That looks pretty simple. You do need write access to the location where the org-file is though. Let us look at a version that copies the file to a temporary directory. For some reason, I am not able to use org-babel-load-file with this. But, it does look like I can tangle the file, and assuming (big assumption) that the file tangles to a regularly named .el file, this seems to work too.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun org-require (orgfile)
  "orgfile is a symbol to be loaded"
  (let ((org-file (concat (symbol-name orgfile) ".org"))
        (el-file (concat (symbol-name orgfile) ".el"))
	(path))

  ;; find the org-file
  (catch 'result
    (loop for dir in org-load-path do
	  (when (file-exists-p
		 (setq path
		       (concat
			(directory-file-name dir)
			"/"
			org-file)))
	    (throw 'result path))))
  (copy-file path temporary-file-directory t)

  (org-babel-tangle-file (concat temporary-file-directory (file-name-nondirectory path)))
  (load-file (concat temporary-file-directory el-file))
))

(org-require 'org-ref)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
t
</pre>

<p>
This actually seems pretty reasonable. I have not thought about complications but for simple cases, e.g. single org-file, it looks ok.
