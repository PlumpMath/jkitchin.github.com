See it here: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039602815003052">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039602815003052</a>.

The main goal of this post is to test run using a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/summary-large-image">Twitter card</a> to make better tweets about publications.
</p>

<p>
This post did not work quite like I anticipated, mostly because of the way I publish my blog which focuses only on the HTML body. The meta tags that are needed for Twitter do not seem to get put in the header as needed. If I do a regular org export with HTML_HEAD options to get this page: <a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/publications/twitter-card.html">http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/publications/twitter-card.html</a>, it did work. The page is pretty bare, but it could be embellished without much work. 
</p>

<p>
Tweeting that URL led to this tweet: 
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Test tweet with a twitter card: <a href="https://t.co/TagjgTgFmZ">https://t.co/TagjgTgFmZ</a></p>&mdash; John Kitchin (@johnkitchin) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnkitchin/status/769267071645540352">August 26, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
On Twitter, this showed an image of the picture on the page, and linked directly to the page I made. The image is sized a little large and doesn't fit in card quite right, but this is probably fixable. This whole process could be smoothed out a lot with a custom export to get the twitter meta tags in the right place, and maybe provide links to bibtex files, analytics, etc. Sounds like a fun project ;)
