      <description>Finding bibtex entries with no downloaded pdf</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>
We use bibtex for bibiliography management in our group. Almost every journal provides a utility to download bibtex entries, and you can pretty easily download bibtex entries from citeulike. It doesn't take too long though before you have a few hundred entries. You need some tools to interact with that database.
</p>

<p>
Bibtex-mode in Emacs provides some tools for working with your bibtex files. For example, you can (bibtex-validate) to check if entries are correct, and (bibtex-sort-buffer) to sort them by key. 
</p>

<p>
I have a specific workflow to entering new entries. This is what I prefer to do:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Go to journal, get bibtex entry, paste into bibtex file.
</li>
<li>delete the key that is used, if any
</li>
<li>type C-c C-c to autogenerate a key of my style
</li>
<li>Copy the key, download the pdf, and save the pdf as (format "%s.pdf" key) in my pdfs directory.
</li>
<li>Make an entry in a notes file for that reference. These entries are initially tagged as TODO to remind me to organize them.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Doing this has some payoffs; my org-mode cite links can open either the bibtex entry, or the pdf file directly from the org-file! The notes file is also an org-file, which I can organize as I see fit. 
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I am lazy, and do not get all these steps done, especially the pdf download step. I like to have local copies of the pdf files so I can read them even if I am offline, and because I often annotate them using a tablet PC. It also makes it easy to send them to my students if I need to. Periodically, I like to go through my bibtex database to do some maintenance, download missing files, and notes entries etc&#x2026; The problem is how do I know which entries have downloaded pdfs or note entries? It is not that difficult with a bit of elisp.

Using that list, I can click on those links, which takes me to the entry in file. That entry probably has a url or doi that makes it easy to navigate to the journal page where I can download the pdf file. You could improve on the code above by filtering out only articles, for example.

      <description>Finding bibtex entries with non-ascii characters</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>
I have found that some journals cannot handle bibtex entries with non-ascii characters in them. Unfortunately, when you paste bibtex entries into your reference file from the web, there are often non-ascii characters in them. Emacs usually shows those characters just fine, so it is difficult to find them. Here is a little recipe to go through each entry to find entries with non-ascii characters. These range from accented characters, greek letters, degree symbols, dashes, fancy quotes, etc&#x2026; Since they are hard to see by eye, we can let Emacs find them for us, and then replace them with the corresponding ascii LaTeX commands. 
</p>

<p>
I found a function to find non-ascii characters here: <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FindingNonAsciiCharacters">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FindingNonAsciiCharacters</a> . Now, we use a modified version of this on each entry in a bibtex file. If we find a character, we will print an org-mode link to make it easy to get right to the entry.

You can see I only had one reference in that file with a non-ascii character. I think it is best practice to replace these with pure LaTeX commands. See <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters</a> for a good reference on what commands are used for the accented characters.
