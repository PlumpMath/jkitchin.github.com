<b>Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution with an Immobilized TAML Activator</b>
</p>

<p>
Ethan L. Demeter, Shayna L. Hilburg, Newell R. Washburn, Terrence J. Collins, and John R. Kitchin
</p>

<p>
Iron complexes of tetra-amido macrocyclic ligands are important members of the suite of oxidation catalysts known as TAML activators. TAML activators are known to be fast homogeneous water oxidation (WO) catalysts, producing oxygen in the presence of chemical oxidants, e.g., ceric ammonium nitrate. These homogeneous systems exhibited low turnover numbers (TONs). Here we demonstrate immobilization on glassy carbon and carbon paper in an ink composed of the prototype TAML activator, carbon black, and Nafion and the subsequent use of this composition in heterogeneous electrocatalytic WO. The immobilized TAML system is shown to readily produce O2 with much higher TONs than the homogeneous predecessors.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>
The <a href="https://www.cit.cmu.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_awards/dowd.html">Dowd Fellowship</a> is awarded to a faculty member in engineering to recognize educational contributions and to encourage the undertaking of an educational project such as textbook writing, educational technology development, laboratory experience improvement, educational software, or course and curriculum development.
</p>

<p>
Professor Kitchin was recognized for his work in creating the <a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book">dft-book</a> , <a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu">pycse</a> , and their integration into courses. These resources notably integrate technical narrative text, equation, images along with code and the output. He is continuing to develop these resources and similar materials for a new Master's course in chemical reaction engineering.

                  synthesized and characterized with the aim of

                  water had an unexpected impact on the properties of
                  these materials{,} resulting in an increased
                  viscosity{,} but little change in the CO2
                  reactivity."

<b>Identifying Potential BO2 Oxide Polymorphs for Epitaxial Growth Candidates</b>,
by Prateek Mehta, Paul A. Salvador, and John R. Kitchin
<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/am4059149">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/am4059149</a> 
</p>

<p>
Transition metal dioxides (BO2) exhibit a number of polymorphic structures with distinct properties, but the isolation of different polymorphs for a given composition is carried out using trial and error experimentation. We present computational studies of the relative stabilities and equations of state for six polymorphs (anatase, brookite, rutile, columbite, pyrite, and fluorite) of five different BO2 dioxides (B = Ti, V, Ru, Ir, and Sn). These properties were computed in a consistent fashion using several exchange correlation functionals within the density functional theory formalism, and the effects of the different functionals are discussed relative to their impact on predictive synthesis. We compare the computational results to prior observations of high-pressure synthesis and epitaxial film growth and then use this discussion to predict new accessible polymorphs in the context of epitaxial stabilization using isostructural substrates. For example, the relative stabilities of the columbite polymorph for VO2 and RuO2 are similar to those of TiO2 and SnO2, the latter two of which have been previously stabilized as epitaxial films.
