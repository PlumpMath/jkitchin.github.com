<b>Identifying Potential BO2 Oxide Polymorphs for Epitaxial Growth Candidates</b>,
by Prateek Mehta, Paul A. Salvador, and John R. Kitchin
<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/am4059149">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/am4059149</a> 
</p>

<p>
Transition metal dioxides (BO2) exhibit a number of polymorphic structures with distinct properties, but the isolation of different polymorphs for a given composition is carried out using trial and error experimentation. We present computational studies of the relative stabilities and equations of state for six polymorphs (anatase, brookite, rutile, columbite, pyrite, and fluorite) of five different BO2 dioxides (B = Ti, V, Ru, Ir, and Sn). These properties were computed in a consistent fashion using several exchange correlation functionals within the density functional theory formalism, and the effects of the different functionals are discussed relative to their impact on predictive synthesis. We compare the computational results to prior observations of high-pressure synthesis and epitaxial film growth and then use this discussion to predict new accessible polymorphs in the context of epitaxial stabilization using isostructural substrates. For example, the relative stabilities of the columbite polymorph for VO2 and RuO2 are similar to those of TiO2 and SnO2, the latter two of which have been previously stabilized as epitaxial films.

Simulating Temperature Programmed Desorption of Oxygen on Pt(111) Using DFT Derived Coverage Dependent Desorption Barriers

Abstract

The dissociative adsorption energy of oxygen on Pt(111) is known to be coverage dependent. Simple Redhead analysis of temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments that assumes a coverage independent desorption barrier can lead to errors in estimated properties such as desorption barriers and adsorption energies. A simple correction is to assume a linear coverage dependence of the desorption barrier, but there is usually no formal justification given for that functional form. More advanced TPD analysis methods that are suitable for determining coverage dependent adsorption parameters are limited by their need for large amounts of high quality, low noise data. We present a method to estimate the functional form of the coverage dependent desorption barrier from density functional theory calculations for use in analysis of TPD spectra. Density functional theory was employed to calculate the coverage dependence of the adsorption energy. Simulated TPD spectra were then produced by empirically scaling the DFT based adsorption energies utilizing the Bronstead-Evans-Polyani relationship between adsorption energies and desorption barriers. The resulting simulated spectra show better agreement with the experimental spectra than spectra predicted using barriers that are either coverage-independent or simply linearly dependent on coverage. The empirically derived scaling of the desorption barriers for Pt(111) is shown to be useful in predicting the low coverage desorption barriers for oxygen desorption from other metal surfaces, which showed reasonable agreement with the reported experimental values for those other metals.

<p>
Relating the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of the 3d Transition Metal Monoxide Surfaces
</p>

<p>
Zhongnan Xu, and  John R. Kitchin
</p>

<p>
We performed a series of density functional theory calculations of dissociative oxygen adsorption on fcc metals and their corresponding rocksalt monoxides to elucidate the relationship between the oxide electronic structure and its corresponding reactivity. We decomposed the dissociative adsorption energy of oxygen on an oxide surface into a sum of the adsorption energy on the metal and a change in adsorption energy caused by both expanding and oxidizing the lattice. We were able to identify the key features of the electronic structure that explains the trends in adsorption energies on 3d transition metal monoxide surfaces.

<p>
Our paper "Effects of O2 and SO2 on the capture capacity of a primary-amine based polymeric CO2 sorbent" by Alexander Hallenbeck and John R. Kitchin was accepted today in Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research. In this paper we showed that the ion exchange resin OC1065 is  susceptible to poisoning by SO2, but that it can be partially chemically regenerated. It can also be damaged by long term exposure to air at elevated temperatures.
