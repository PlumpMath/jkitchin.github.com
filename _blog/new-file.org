If I create a new file and save it, it just saves. I guess the hook function is totally local to the previous buffer. That makes sense, since it is wrapped in a minor mode.

Let us add that hook in this file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'after-save-hook 'ensure-in-vc-or-checkin nil 'make-it-local)
#+END_SRC

Now the first time I save this, it is added as a new file. The second time I save it, I am asked for a commit message. Subsequent saves ask for a commit message.
