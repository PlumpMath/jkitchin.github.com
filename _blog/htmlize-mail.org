* Send org files by html email so they look like org files.
  :PROPERTIES:
  :MAIL_FMT: html
  :END:

We might not always want a full export of an org heading to html for sending an email. Eric Brown would like to just send something that looks like what he sees in org-mode. There is another way to get html from emacs: htmlize! Here is an example. Eric: if this is what you mean, see my modified org-mime.el at https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/org-mime.el. 

The command to send a subtree is: elisp:org-mime-subtree-htmlize


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
My comment was motivated by other usage where I wish that I could simply
wrap an entire simple text, whitespace-formatted email message,
e.g. generated from org export to a plain text buffer, with a Monospace
directive so that webmail users could appreciate what I see with Sans
Mono.

An equation \(e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\)

A figure:

A code block:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
#+END_SRC
