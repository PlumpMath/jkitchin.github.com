#+TITLE: Kitchingroup ELPA 

This is an Emacs ELPA repository for our packages. The files here are experimental. 

If you want to install one, add this repository to your emacs like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)

(add-to-list
 'package-archives
 '("kitchingroup" . "http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/elpa/") t)
#+END_SRC

You may need to refresh the contents.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package-refresh-contents)
#+END_SRC


Now, to install something try this.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq package-load-list '(all))     ;; List of packages to load

(unless (package-installed-p 'techela)  ;; Make sure the Org package is
  (package-install 'techela))           ;; installed, install it if not

(package-initialize)                ;; Initialize & Install Package
#+END_SRC
