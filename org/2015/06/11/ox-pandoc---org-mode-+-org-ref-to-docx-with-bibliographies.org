https://github.com/kawabata/ox-pandoc][ox-pandoc]]. It seems like it makes it easy to convert org-mode to other formats, including docx. Let us try it out.

** The setup
We  have to modify org-ref to insert LaTeX style citations. We do that here.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq helm-bibtex-format-citation-functions
      '((org-mode . (lambda (x) (insert (concat
					 "\\cite{"
					 (mapconcat 'identity x ",")
					 "}")) ""))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| org-mode | lambda | (x) | (insert (concat \cite{ (mapconcat (quote identity) x ,) })) |

We have to add ox-pandoc and require it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "ox-pandoc" starter-kit-dir))
(require 'ox-pandoc)
#+END_SRC

** The document
Now, for some text. Grindy wrote this nice paper on approaching chemical accuracy with density functional  calculations \cite{grindy-2013-approac}. Two other interesting papers include these ones \cite{guldner-1961,guerrini-2008-effec-feo}.

An equation: \(e^x = 4\).

And a figure with a caption:

#+caption: Make sure this is in your org-file.

** Summary
This is better than what I have seen in the past. ox-pandoc has some options that might tailor the bibliography to specific formats. You lose some functionality of org-ref cite links by using raw LaTeX, but if that is not a deal breaker this might be a good way to go for some purposes.

Here is the word document that results from this file: file:test-doc.docx
