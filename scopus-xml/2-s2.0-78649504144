                    <ce:para>The water gas shift reactions (WGS) are widely used in several industrial processes and are catalyzed by Cu catalysts. WGS is used to produce high purity hydrogen and the reverse reaction (RWGS) is essential for upgrading CO
                        <inf>2</inf> to CO. In many fossil fuel derived CO
                        <inf>2</inf> feedstocks, there are sulfur (S) impurities which can adsorb on the Cu surfaces and block the active sites of the catalyst for the desired reaction and can result in catalyst deactivation. However, there is hydrogen pressure which can destabilize the adsorbed S by forming H
                        <inf>2</inf>S that may desorb from the catalyst surface. The extent of destabilization depends on the chemical potentials of the species which are determined by reaction conditions. Moreover, occupancy of the active sites could also caused by the presence of other possible adsorbates such as CO and O. To determine the interactions between possible adsorbates with Cu catalyst, the adsorption properties of these different adsorbates on low Miller index facets of Cu surfaces were studied considering the thermodynamic equilibrium of facets with the reactive environment. The aim of this work is to combine atomistic thermodynamics with a computational approach (DFT) to understand the structure and stability of different adsorbate poisoned Cu catalysts that are in equilibrium with their environment and to investigate the effect of hydrogen gas in destabilizing the possible adsorbates. The adsorbate phase diagrams on each surface were constructed as a function of corresponding chemical potentials which showed S poisoning occurs even at ppm levels of H2S in the environment. We found out that the presence of hydrogen pressure can be utilized to regenerate poisoned slabs at high temperatures. The shapes of a Cu nanoparticle under to various experimental conditions were determined using the Wulff construction which points out significant change in catalyst morphologies under reactive environment conditions.</ce:para>
