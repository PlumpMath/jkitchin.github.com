Recent years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in this subject, motivated by experiments demonstrating charge-selective transport of ions and solutes in nanofluidic devices. In this paper, we revisit and build upon the prototypical problem of one-dimensional ion transport across a flat ideally ion-selective surface, by examining the influence of imposed fluid flows on concentration polarization, over-limiting current, and second-kind (non-equilibrium) electro-osmotic instability at the surface. Specifically, we consider a simple model system of a cation-selective surface or membrane that admits a uniform fluid flow across itself. The membrane resides against a binary symmetric electrolyte, whose concentration is uniform in a "well-mixed" region at a prescribed distance from the membrane. A potential difference across the system drives an ionic current, leading to concentration polarization in the "unstirred layer" between the membrane and well-mixed bulk. The concentration polarization profile reflects a balance between advection of ions with the imposed "normal flow" and diffusion. The relative importance of these effects is parameterized by a Pećlet number Pe; notably, Pe is a signed quantity as the flow can be imposed toward or away from the membrane. An asymptotic analysis in the thin-Debye-layer limit reveals a significant impact of normal flow on concentration polarization and the advection-diffusion limiting current across the membrane. In particular, there exists a nonlinear concentration profile in the unstirred layer for non-zero Pe, in contrast to the familiar linear (diffusive) concentration polarization at Pe = 0. Next, we use matched asymptotic expansions to explore the structure of the unstirred layer at over-limiting currents, wherein a non-equilibrium space-charge layer develops near the membrane surface. A key step in this process is the derivation of a "generalized master equation" for the electric field across the unstirred layer. Finally, we examine the instability of the quiescent concentration polarization resulting from second-kind electro-osmotic slip in the space-charge layer. A linear stability analysis shows that normal flow can either enhance or retard the instability, depending on the flow direction. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.</ce:para></abstract></dc:description><link href="http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79960909521" rel="self"/><link href="http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&amp;scp=79960909521&amp;origin=inward" rel="scopus"/><link href="http://api.elsevier.com/content/search/scopus?query=refeid%282-s2.0-79960909521%29" rel="cited-by"/></coredata><affiliation href="http://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027950" id="60027950"><affilname>Carnegie Mellon University</affilname><affiliation-city>Pittsburgh</affiliation-city><affiliation-country>United States</affiliation-country></affiliation><authors><author auid="13008288600" seq="1"><ce:initials>A.S.</ce:initials><ce:indexed-name>Khair A.S.</ce:indexed-name><ce:surname>Khair</ce:surname><ce:given-name>Aditya S.</ce:given-name><preferred-name> <ce:initials>A.S.</ce:initials> <ce:indexed-name>Khair A.</ce:indexed-name> <ce:surname>Khair</ce:surname> <ce:given-name>Aditya S.</ce:given-name> </preferred-name><author-url>http://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13008288600</author-url><affiliation href="http://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027950" id="60027950"/></author></authors></abstracts-retrieval-response>
