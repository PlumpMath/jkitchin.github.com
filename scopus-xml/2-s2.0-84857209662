<ce:para>Hydrogen is a promising source of energy for thetransportation sector. It is clean and the technology is becoming available asmany car manufactures plan to offer it in the future (Cole 2007). However, itsdeployment in the market is not ready due to the strength and convenience ofthe liquid fuels industry (the energy density of liquid fuels is much higher),as well as the lack of infrastructure for hydrogen distribution, handling andstorage, resulting in high production costs using current technologies such asreforming of natural gas ($2.6/kg) or water electrolysis ($2.6-$4.2/kg)(Levene, Kroposki, &amp; Sverdrup, 2006). The key issue to make hydrogen anattractive alternative fuel for the transportation sector is to optimize theproduction process from renewable raw materials instead of the more commonprocesses such as natural gas reforming or electrolysis of water (Rand &amp; Dell, 2008). Although biomass has been traditionally regarded asa source of liquid biofuels (i.e. bioethanol, green diesel), it can in factalso be considered as a source of hydrogen as has been reported recently. Gasificationof biomass generates a fair amount of H2 which has to be purifiedand/or separated from the other gases resulting from the gasification(Tanksale, Beltramini, &amp; Lu, 2010). Therefore, recent studies haveevaluated the production of hydrogen from gasification of biomass using asimulation-based approach selecting the technologies involved with good potentialin terms of yield and energy consumption (Feng, Wang, &amp; Min, 2009; Gao, Aimin, &amp; Quan, 2009; Hamelinck &amp; Faaij, 2002; Ji, Feng, &amp; Chen, 2009a, 2009b; Lau et al., 2002; Li, Zeng, &amp; Fan, 2010; Mueller-langer, Tzimas, Kalschmitt, &amp; Peteves, 2007). In this paper we address the conceptual design for the production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic raw materials. The optimizationof the process is formulated as an MINLP using short-cut models, design andempirical correlations for modeling a superstructure embedding two different gasification technologies, direct and indirect gasification, and two reformingmodes, partial oxidation or steam reforming. Finally, following recent trends,a water gas shift reactor (WGSR) with membrane separation is used to obtainpure hydrogen. The problem is solved by constraining the binaryvariables of the MINLP so as to select each gasifier and reforming modeyielding four NLP's. The operating conditions in the gasifiers and at the WGSRare optimized for hydrogen production in the solution of each NLP. Next, theenergy is integrated, and finally, an economic evaluation is performed todetermine the production cost of each of the four alternatives. It is shownthat indirect gasification with steam reforming is the preferred technologyproviding higher production yields than the ones reported in the literature forhydrogen from natural gas and at a potentially lower and promising productioncost 0.67 $/kg with a yield of 0.11 kg/kg wet biomass. Finally, an important issue topoint out is the fact that this process generates CO <inf>2</inf>, 1.2 kg/kg <inf>Biomass</inf>together with 0.11kgH <inf>2</inf> /kg <inf>Biomass</inf>.It has recently been reported that the production of biodiesel from algae is apromising technology with a yield to biodiesel 10-100 times higher than usingthe current raw materials like soy bean or rapeedseed (Yusuf, 2007). However,it needs plenty of CO <inf>2</inf>. This process could be a source for growingthe algae. Biodiesel production requires in the range of 3.6 kg of CO <inf>2</inf> per kg of biodiesel (Pate, 2008; Sazdanoff, 2006). Thus, on a kg of biomassbasis, it would be possible to obtain 0.33 kg <inf>Biodiesel</inf>/kg <inf>Biomass</inf> together with the hydrogen produced which provides full use of the biomasswhile producing short-term and long term biofuels with good integration ofdifferent processes. According to the DOE, by using algae for the productionof biodiesel it would be possible to meet the demand for biodiesel with 2-5% of the current cropland and with no consumption of water, since salt water canalso be used.</ce:para>
