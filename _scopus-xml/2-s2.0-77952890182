<ce:para>In the past decade, research and development activities for commercialization of fuel cell (FC) systems have increased rapidly as a potential power source for stationary, portable and automotive systems. Compared to conventional battery systems, the advantages of these systems are high operating efficiency, near-zero greenhouse emissions, operation on renewable fuels, reliable operation, and nearly instantaneous recharge capabilities [1]. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) FCs have especially received attention owing to their higher power densities over the other types of FCs. Significant progress has been made in this technology since the 1960s. At fundamental scientific level, Du Pont's perfluorosulphonic acid membrane, having a hundred times more power density due to enhanced conductivity and about the same enhancement in lifetime, replaced the polystyrene sulfonic acid membrane [2], Currently, the state-of-the-art Gore membranes as thin as 10 urn, have the added advantage of lower ohmic losses with equivalent or higher mechanical strength than the 100 Î¼m Nafion membranes. The catalyst loading has decreased to 0.1 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> [2]. In spite of these developments many issues need to be addressed before the commercial entry of these systems. These can broadly classified into material design issues and operating issues. The material design issues are to reduce the cost of the membrane, the electro-catalyst, the bipolar plates and the fuel storage and transportation materials. Also new materials need to be designed to reduce the operating cost by improving the system power density. This can be achieved by the discovery of better electro-catalysts and higher proton conduction membranes which can operate at higher temperatures. Amongst the operating issues is the optimization of water and thermal management which require efficient water and heat removals from the system and finding out operating conditions for best performance. In this paper, a comprehensive hydrogen PEMFC model is built which takes into account the transport processes in the gas channels (GCs) and the membrane electrode assembly. We have used differential balance equations of total mass, momentum and species, descriptive for the transport processes in the GC and gas diffusion layer (GDL, modified with a darcy's drag term). To illustrate the essence of integrated physical modeling with optimization scheme, we made the following simplified assumptions: constant physical properties (isothermal and incompressible flow), uniformity of the materials (isotropic media for GDL, and uniformity of current density), as well as 2D laminar flow approximation, thin catalyst layers, single vapor phase assumption for water. Watertransport within the PEM including diffusion, electro-osmotic drag, and hydraulic drag was rigorously incorporated in our model. The resulting system of partial differential-algebraic equations is fully discretized using a finite volume scheme leading to a large-scale nonlinear system of equations which are solved simultaneously using an interior point optimization (IPOPT) solver [3], Parametric studies were performed with parameters such as the flow-arrangement, inlet gas humidity, PEM thickness, inlet gas velocity, current density, and operating pressure. While the first three parameters show a monotonous behavior with the system performance, the system power density possesses a maximum with the inlet gas velocity and the current density. Following summarizes the findings from our model: Counter-flow arrangement leads to better performance than the co-flow arrangement especially for the conditions of low inlet humidity and pressure. There is an internal water recirculation which facilitates higher PEM hydration as compared to the co-flow case. Inlet gas humidity: As inlet gas humidities increase the overall water uptake in the system increases which improves the ionic conductivity of the PEM and enhances the overall system performance. PEM thickness: The performance of thinner PEMs is significantly better. This can be explained by the fact that thin PEMs provide lower ionic resistance to proton transport due to smaller thickness, and also due to a higher water uptake. Inlet gas velocity: The system power density possesses a maximum as inlet gas velocity increases. As the current density increases the optimal velocity also increases. Current density: As the current density increases the system power density goes through a maximum. Optimal current density is calculated to maximize the power density. Pressure: As the operating pressure increases, the performance improves mainly because of increase in reactant concentration and also due to higher water generation because of increased electrochemical reaction rate.</ce:para>
